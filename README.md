Introductory repository

Hello GitHub! 

I'm an aspiring coder, hoping to learn the trade to work in web dev. I'm brushing up on my HTML & CSS skills, while learning JS, Ruby, and Python. 
In my day job, I'm curently a researcher and clinican-in-training with experience in stats programming languages and a fierce interest in learning more. 

Glad to finally connect with the GitHub community!
